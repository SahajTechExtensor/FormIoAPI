Form.io Angular JSON Form Renderer
==========================
This library serves as a Dynamic JSON Powered Form rendering library for [Angular](https://angular.io). This works by
providing a JSON schema to a ```<formio>``` Angular component, where that form is dynamically rendered within the front
end application. This allows forms to be dynamically built using JSON schemas.

Angular Versions
-------------------------
This library supports many different Angular Versions. If you wish to use this library with your specific version of Angular, then you will need to install the following versions.

## Angular 17
Angular 17 versions are currently released as "latest" so you can install with Angular 17 with the following commands.

### NPM
    npm install --save @formio/angular

Usage
----------------
To use this library within your project, you will first need to install it as a dependency.

```
npm install --save formiojs
```

Bootstrap Versions

Angular Data Grid Component
-----------------

```

angular elements
-----------------
If you have any questions, create a new issue in this repo by choosing "Custom Components Support Request".

Starting from angular-formio v4.3.0 you can register an Angular component as a formio field. It uses the @angular/elements in the background, so that package is required as peer dependency.

```
npm install --save @angular/elements
```
